# CIC-IDS-Incremental
Testing Incremental Learning methods on the CIC IDS 2018 dataset

The Jupyter notebook tests the effects of learning new classes incrementally for a CNN model using the CIC IDS 2018 dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/solarmainframe/ids-intrusion-csv. The CSV files are downloaded to google drive which is mounted in the Google Collab runtime to enable access. The first 2 days/CSV files are used by default for a total of 5 classes. Various pre-processing methods are used for data cleaning prior to organizing, training and testing.

The baseline CNN model is adapted from one of the code notebooks attached to the Kaggle dataset page.
